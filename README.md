# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Random Shops is a Redux project where people can order pizza without authentication.

This project was built on the Fast React Pizza Co webiste made in Jonas Schmedtmann's react course mentioned below, but instead of using the same api link. i used the FakeStoreApi which had other items to be put on display, but the webiste keeps the same functionalities. 

## Technologies
